___
Tired of certain crewmates insisting that you should **ONLY** go to Titan and Artifice?
___

### So called """Reasons:"""
- "they have the most loot"
- "why are we going to embrion we are going to die for no reason"
- "rend and dine are stupid >:("

Well, this mod gives them reasons to explore the other 11 moons god-emporer Zeekers has lovingly handcrafted after the first quota!

___
## What the mod do:

Adds diminishing returns to scrap generation when visiting the same moon in too small of a time span.

### In addition:
- A flat discount for paid moons to make it more economical.
- Bonus Scrap Anomalies, in other words a bonus to scrap generation on a random moon some days. (_maybe you'll have a reason to go to embrion, maybe_)

To see current levels of diminish and the current bonus moon, use the new terminal command: **TRACKER**
